## Instructions

### Dev Console

https://developers.google.com/+/hangouts/publishing#dev-console

NOTE:

At the moment it's a bit confusing; the new UI doesn't seem to be complete; some tasks had to be done with old one.

## Install

The gadget doesn't have to be public. If you've finished the process with the dev console you'll see it in your Hangout
widget list (dev category).
